This repository holds the code and instructions to spin up a Databricks notebook and cluster, upload and process data, and create a Medallion Architecture. The dataset used is the Ergast F1 dataset.

Credit where it is due: this material is taken from the Udemy course by Ramesh Retnasamy, "Real World Project on Formula1 Racing using Databricks, PySpark, Spark SQL, Delta Lake, Unity Catalog, Azure Data Factory"
As I completed course material, I uploaded what I did so I can return to it and practice further.
